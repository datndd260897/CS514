0. Summarize the time complexities of the basic operations (push, pop-min, peek, build) for these implementations of priority queue:

(a) unsorted array
- push:
- pop-min:
- peek:
- build:

(b) sorted array (highest priority first; i.e., "most urgent patient first")
- push:
- pop-min:
- peek:
- build:

(c) reversely sorted array (lowest priority first)
- push:
- pop-min:
- peek:
- build:

(d) sorted linked list (highest priority first)
- push:
- pop-min:
- peek:
- build:

(e) binary heap
- push:
- pop-min:
- peek:
- build:
